Supervised Learning with Logistic Regression

 The project involves data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation to identify creditworthiness of borrowers.
 
 The dataset contains information about loan_size, interest_rate, borrower_income, debt_to_income, num_of_accounts, derogatory_marks, total_debt,and loan_status. The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set. 
 
 I used a logistic regression model as the baseline model and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
